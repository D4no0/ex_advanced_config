# Overview
This document contains a list of other libraries that are already dealing with this problem.
An analysis will be done on the following things: 

* Features - the feature set and what this library tries to achieve;
* Ease of usage and compatibility with elixir config - a conclusion on how easy is to integrate the library in new projects, as well as in already existing projects. It is also important to point out the compatibility with default elixir configuration system, as this can become an important factor to adoption in projects where compatibility with the elixir configuration is critical;
* Adoption - an observation on the current adoption based on github stars and downloads from hex, maybe some forum discussions if available;
* Observed problems - observation of issues opened on the library github and addressed on the forum;
* Vision conflicts - observations on features that will conflict with the vision of the current library.
